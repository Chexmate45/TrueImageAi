How to get started?
First of all go to https://www.kaggle.com/nafisur/dogs-vs-cats/version/1 and download that
move all of the photos in testing to training according to folder name

run makedogcat.py [directory of training set] BUT if the directory has any '\'s make sure to put TWO of them instead of one 
EXAMPLE:
Dont do: User\\Desktop\\
do: User\\\Desktop\\\
Let that run for a minute
then
run rundogcat.py
then
have a image file of a cat or dog in the same folder as all of these files
then
run testdogcat.py [Name of image file] and there you go top stuuffff
